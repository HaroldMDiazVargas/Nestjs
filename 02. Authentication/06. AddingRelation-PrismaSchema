Relationshuip between schemas
    Definition:
      - Quite often we need to make relationships between the different schemas:
        - SQL => Between tables
        -  NoSQL => Between collections, here we don't have really this concept!
    
    User vs Bookmark relationship:
      - We want to define a 1 to Many relationship:
        - 1 user can have multiple Bookmarks
        - 1 Bookmark can be only of 1 user

    Prisma schema
      @relation() decorator:
       - We use this to make a relationship:
         - fields:[fieldName] => we set the fieldName of our schema we want to relate
         - references:[] => we set the fieldName of the outside schema we want to relate
      
      Opposite relation field:
        - Always in prisma we need to define in both sides of the schemas the relation
          In this case we want to make 1 TO Many relationship!
        - In the User schema we define a new field!
