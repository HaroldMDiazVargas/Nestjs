Pactum
    Definition:
      - Library that we use to implment e2e tests
      - Allows us to save a lot of time for testing our APIs, very nice to work
      - Works very well with GraphQL
    
    supertest library:
      - By default Nestjs uses this for the E2E test but we will use pactumjs
      - Also to take into account NestJs uses Jest Test framework

    PactumJs:
      Installation:
       - npm install -D pactum    

    Consideratios
      Set test database:
       - We want to keep separate our test db from the dev db
      Set up the database 
       - set up prisma service to be cleaned up everytime we run our test
