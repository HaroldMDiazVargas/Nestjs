Scripts to run
    Definition:
      - If we are using docker to create database image is a good idea to create 
        a custom script in our json file to delete and create again the database!
      - Also like we are using prisma, is a good idea to create a custom script to 
        migrate the database
      These two scripts should be in a SINGLE script, so we can create a 3rd new 
      script that executes these two
    
    Scripts:
      Docker:
       - If we are using docker we can create these two scripts such as:
         - "db:dev:rm": "docker compose rm dev-db -s -f -v"
         - "db:dev:up": "docker compose up dev-db -d"
      Prisma:
       - We want to create a custom script to migrate:
         - "prisma:dev:deploy": "prisma migrate deploy"
      Combine these scripts:
       - yarn:
         - "db:dev:restart": "yarn db:dev:rm && yarn db:dev:up && sleep 1 && yarn prisma:dev:deploy"
       - npm:
         - "db:dev:restart": "npm run db:dev:rm && npm run db:dev:up && sleep 1 && npm run prisma:dev:deploy"

    Notes: "sleep" is used to wait for migration because can happen that in a slow 
           machine is not created yet our database!

    Running:
      - So everytime we want to restart our database and apply migration, we run 
        the last script. This allows us to save time!


-- scripts:
    "prisma:dev:deploy": "prisma migrate deploy",
    "db:dev:rm": "docker compose rm dev-db -s -f -v",
    "db:dev:up": "docker compose up dev-db -d",
    "db:dev:restart": "yarn db:dev:rm && yarn db:dev:up && sleep 1 && yarn prisma:dev:deploy",
