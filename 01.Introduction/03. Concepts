Basic Concepts
    Module:
      - We define a module to split/break down our code to make it more scalable
        and easy to test
      - We can separate different modules such as authentication, database, user, so on
      - We can make this nested architecture!

    Controllers
      - Will call the server, will handle the request from client
      - Will receive a request from internet, then call a function from the service
      - Finally returns the result back to the client/brower
      - Check headers, check body

    Service
      - Will worry about the business logic part
