Complex App
    Definition:
      - Like our app starts to grow up, we will end with much Endpoints/files/services, ...
      - This makes tedious to test with Postman
    
    Unit testing:
      - Just test at unit level!
      - Simple functions isolated, mocking services, so on!

    Integration Testing:
      - Can test many parts such as:
        - is signin() token sign correctly
        - exepction throws are correctly
      - Nestjs thanks to its architecture-modular can integrate various modules 
        on different integration tests very easily, e.g:
        - test auth with user and prisma but without bookmark
        - so on
        
    E2E Testing:
      - Verifies very high level usage journey of our app:
        - Sign in
        - Request profiel
        - User does this.. does that...
